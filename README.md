Race to a Billion is a social game about choosing spaces off a board to win money and trying not to blow up. It's a lot of fun!

You can try the bot out in this server: https://discord.gg/QzQP9n4D6r

If you want to work on improving the bot, great! More minigames and events are always welcome, for more structural changes it might be better to make an issue topic first to discuss it.

Major updates are generally timed to coincide with someone reaching the goal, so about halfway to that we lock down the "current" version and start looking at more significant changes to make for the next season. You can still contribute as normal during that time (and I would welcome it), but new features won't be added to the game right away.
